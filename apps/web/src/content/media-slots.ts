/**
 * The image slot registry (pages redesign, 15 Oct 2026; docs/design/DECISIONS.md). Every
 * `<MediaSlot>` names one of these ids, and the type makes an unregistered id a compile error.
 * `pnpm media:slots` writes docs/design/IMAGE-SLOTS.md from this file, and a unit test fails when
 * the document is out of date.
 *
 * To add the real image: save it as `apps/web/public/media/{file}.{avif,webp,jpg,png}` at the
 * recommended size (for a per-item slot, `{file}` is the id, a dot, then the item's slug). The
 * slot renders it in place of the placeholder; nothing shifts, because the ratio is fixed here.
 *
 * Rules: real photography, screenshots or diagrams of Vitalos work only. No stock or
 * AI-generated imagery, and nothing that implies a client, outcome or person that is not real.
 *
 * This file has no imports, so `node` can load it directly (type stripping) for the doc script.
