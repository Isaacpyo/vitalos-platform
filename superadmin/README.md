# Vitalos Super Admin

The internal system of record for the Vitalos company architecture, at **https://admin.vitalos.co.uk** (deployment: [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md)).

It holds the company north star (vision, mission and the ADVISE · BUILD · OPERATE · CREATE business modes) and the six service lines. Each line has its own Practices → Solutions → Offers, team, projects, KPIs and decisions. Records are classified Public, Internal, Confidential or Restricted, archived rather than deleted, and every change is in the history.

Stack: Python 3.12, Django 5.2 LTS, HTMX 2 (django-htmx), Tailwind CSS v4 (standalone CLI, no Node), PostgreSQL 17, django-simple-history, django-axes, django-otp, django-csp, Django REST Framework with drf-spectacular, WhiteNoise and gunicorn. See [ADR-026](../docs/adr/ADR-026-superadmin-django.md).

Business rules live in `services.py` (writes) and `selectors.py` (reads and visibility), never in views or templates. Server-only settings and secrets come from environment variables ([.env.example](.env.example)).

## Develop

```sh
cd superadmin
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
bin/tailwind.sh --watch &                        # builds static/css/app.css
python manage.py migrate && python manage.py seed_architecture
BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD='<12+ characters>' python manage.py create_superadmin --email you@vitalos.co.uk
python manage.py runserver
```

Windows: `bin/tailwind.sh` has no Windows binary. Download the `tailwindcss-windows-x64.exe` release of the pinned version (see `VERSION` in `bin/tailwind.sh`) from the Tailwind CSS GitHub releases and run it manually with the same arguments as the script (`-i assets/tailwind.css -o static/css/app.css`, plus `--watch` or `--minify`).

Refreshing the pinned dependencies (the lockfiles must match the Linux image, so always pass `--python-platform linux`):

```sh
uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt --python-version 3.12 --python-platform linux
uv pip compile requirements-dev.in -o requirements-dev.txt --python-version 3.12 --python-platform linux
```

Or run `docker compose up --build`, which gives PostgreSQL 17 plus the app on http://localhost:8000.

## Quality gates (CI: `.github/workflows/superadmin.yml`)

```sh
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
pytest                                          # 110 tests; DATABASE_URL=postgres://… to match CI
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.prod … python manage.py check --deploy --fail-level WARNING
pip-audit --strict -r requirements.txt
bandit -r apps config -c pyproject.toml
```

CI also builds the image, runs the release job twice, checks a backup, and drives `e2e/smoke.py` against the production container.

## Management commands

- `seed_architecture` loads the company profile, roles and six service lines. It is idempotent and never overwrites edits.
- `create_superadmin [--email EMAIL] [--password]` creates the bootstrap SuperAdmin if it is missing, and otherwise leaves the account unchanged. The password is read **only** from `$BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. `--password` is a flag that resets only an existing account's password from that variable.
- `create_owner` creates or confirms the primary owner (`$PRIMARY_OWNER_EMAIL`, `admin@vitalos.co.uk`) with no password. The release job runs it when the variable is set. Idempotent; other SuperAdmins are untouched.
- `issue_setup_link --email admin@vitalos.co.uk` prints a single-use set-password link, valid for 30 minutes, to the terminal only.
- `send_enquiry_notifications` flushes pending enquiry notifications and sends the 08:00 digest. Schedule it every 5 minutes (a Container Apps job, [docs/email-setup.md](docs/email-setup.md) section 8).
- `enforce_enquiry_retention` applies the 24-month retention. It is a dry run unless `RETENTION_ENFORCE=true`.
- `aidata_retention [--apply]` anonymises AI & Data opportunities closed more than 24 months ago (dry run without `--apply`; not scheduled).
- `import_repo_content <file.json> [--apply]` imports Insights and roles exported from the repo content source as drafts (dry run by default; idempotent by source path; placeholders refused).
- `product_access --email EMAIL [--grant CODENAME | --revoke CODENAME]` shows, grants or revokes a user's Product Pipeline permissions (`view_product_pipeline`, `open_askbridge_superadmin`, `open_answerd_superadmin`, `open_workforce_superadmin`, `open_tipsignal_superadmin`) and audits each change. Granting a product permission also grants `view_product_pipeline`. SuperAdmins already hold them all.
- `content_tick [--loop]` promotes due scheduled posts, closes roles past their closing date and delivers pending website sync events (ADR-042). `--loop` runs it every 60 seconds for local development. The admin also runs it in the background, at most once a minute, when it serves the content API or an Insights, Careers or Content page.

Mail (inbound Worker, Resend, DNS, secrets) is set up by the owner with [docs/email-setup.md](docs/email-setup.md); design in [ADR-029](../docs/adr/ADR-029-superadmin-enquiries-mail-console.md).

Decisions and assumptions: [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md). Next phase: [docs/PHASE2.md](docs/PHASE2.md).
