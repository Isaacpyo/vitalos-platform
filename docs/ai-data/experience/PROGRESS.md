# Progress, decisions, evidence and blockers

Newest entries first. Each entry gives the time (UTC), what changed, and the evidence or the next step.

## Current state

- **M0 to M8 done, live in production.** #106 was merged on the owner's instruction (`dd61f63`, 28 Oct 23:40) and deployed: the website on Vercel, the Super Admin on Azure with its migrations, and `portal.vitalos.co.uk` bound with a managed certificate. The AI switches are off and no customer has been invited.
- **Next:** the model key and the live evaluation (HANDOFF.md, "Known issues and configuration blockers"), then the first invited customer.

## Facts established (28 Oct 2026, before implementation)

Verified working; no rebuild needed:

- **Enquiry durability (ADR-019):**
  - `submit_enquiry` writes the enquiry and its outbox row in one transaction.
  - The idempotency key is unique; a replay returns the original reference.
  - The AI & Data form already sends `idempotencyKey`, and has a test.
- **Notification delivery:**
  - The outbox has a lease (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), counts attempts, and dead-letters to `failed`.
  - Retryable and permanent errors are told apart.
  - Delivery happens best-effort straight after submit (`after()`), with a daily Vercel cron (`/api/internal/outbox/dispatch`, 06:00) as the fallback.
- **AI:**
  - `apps.aicore` gateway: providers are Anthropic (official SDK), OpenAI-compatible, Simulated, Replay and Recording.
  - It has a kill switch, per-run, daily and monthly caps, schema validation and metering (`ModelExecution`).
  - The demonstrator's offline evaluation AC-1 to AC-13 passes.
- **Super Admin roles:** SuperAdmin, ServiceLead and Viewer. A user without a role has no access.
- **Payments:** `/pay` and the Super Admin billing are live (#104).

Existing functionality that needs improvement (in scope):

- The `/ai-data` hero is oversized and text-only.
- The demonstrator is explanatory rather than usable.
- The contact page is a plain form.
- The admin AI & Data overview is navigation cards rather than a work queue.
- The opportunity page has no brief, discovery or proposal workspace.

Missing functionality (in scope):

- A guided brief.
- AI-prepared briefs with sources.
- Discovery packs and proposal drafts.
- Durable AI task states in the admin.
- The whole client portal: no customer auth, organisations, projects, deliverables or approvals exist.

Blocked by configuration (not in code):

- **Live AI.** The live provider is off and there is no `AI_DATA_LLM_API_KEY` (the organisation's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not shared with this repo), so live AI results and the demonstrator's AC-14 cannot be produced. Every AI surface ships with an honest unavailable state and a non-AI path.
- **Stripe.** No Vitalos Stripe key or webhook secret is configured.
- **Turnstile on the Super Admin.** `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` is not set for the Super Admin, so `/pay/checkout/` relies on the honeypot and rate limits only.
- **Outbox fallback cadence.** On the Vercel Hobby plan, cron fallback dispatch is daily; a notification retry may take up to a day if `after()` fails. This is an existing limitation, recorded in ADR-019.

Outside this implementation's scope:

- Live monitoring integrations.
- Contractual e-signature.
- Product-incubation scoring.
- Autonomous outreach.

## Log

- **30 Oct 11:05: Files upload, Account settings layout, readable email links (W14; branch `worktree-agent-a07b00b230b317a7c`, not merged).**
  - **Push, confirmed on a real phone:** the owner's own test after the Phase 2 deploy passed on 30 Oct 2026 (Android Chrome or desktop; the owner said "test notification worked"). This closes the "Next" step of the Phase 2 entry below.
  - **Files, "Upload a file":** a primary button at the top right of Files (and in the empty state) opens a native `<dialog>` with the file, the challenge (only this organisation's shared challenges), an optional project (published, grouped by challenge, filtered by the chosen challenge) and an optional title.
    - Before upload it states the accepted types and the 10 MB limit, both built from `files.py`, and the privacy line.
    - Validation stays on the server. A refusal comes back inline in the open dialog, by HTMX or, without JavaScript, as a full page. Success redirects to the file with a toast.
    - Viewers, members with no shared challenge and staff preview see the button disabled with the reason under it.
    - A project from another challenge is now refused by the service, not only by the form.
  - **Account settings:** a section menu beside the content (a sticky chip row at 52rem or narrower). It holds Profile, Sign-in & security, Notifications on this device, Notification preferences and Install the app.
    - The Account sections are anchors on `/account/`, so existing URLs and the push and install hooks are unchanged.
    - Notification preferences keeps its own URL inside the same shell.
    - Two-step setup uses the shell too.
  - **Email links:** the shared layout now links https addresses in text blocks (the invitation's fallback line) and footer links in the link colour, underlined. Dark mode uses `blue100`: 10.47:1 on the card, where a client's default blue was 1.41:1. See ADR-030 (30 Oct note) and `docs/email/README.md`.
  - **Evidence:**
    - `tests/test_portal_files_upload_ui.py` (35 tests), the email layout package (63 tests) and its golden fixtures, the dependants (web, Relay) and the full Super Admin suite (1728 tests on PostgreSQL) all pass.
    - Playwright on synthetic seed data: 32 Files checks and 22 Account checks pass. axe WCAG 2.2 AA finds 0 violations on Files, the open dialog, the dialog with an error, Account and Notification preferences, in light and dark. There is no horizontal overflow at 320, 390 or 768.
    - Screenshots are in the W14 scratchpad (`shots/w14/`).

- **30 Oct 07:50: client portal Phase 2, push notifications (W12; branch `worktree-agent-a16a875ec3d1a6a2a`, not merged).**
  - **Built:** standard Web Push (RFC 8030) with VAPID (RFC 8292) and `aes128gcm` encryption (RFC 8291), on `cryptography` 50.0.2 primitives only. It has:
    - devices per member (`PushSubscription`, at most ten active, a coarse label such as "Chrome on Android") and durable `PushDelivery` records with bounded retries; migration `portal` 0005 is additive;
    - push toggles per kind beside email on Notification preferences;
    - a "Notifications on this device" card on Account (unavailable, iOS not installed, off, on, blocked), a device list and "Send a test notification";
    - service worker handlers for `push`, `notificationclick` (same-origin portal paths only) and `pushsubscriptionchange`. It still caches no workspace data.
  - **Privacy and safety:**
    - A lock screen shows a generic line per kind and nothing else: no names, titles or message text.
    - Endpoints must be real push services (an SSRF allowlist), checked when stored and before every send, and redirects are never followed.
    - Signing out turns notifications off on that browser.
  - **Keys:** the deploy workflow generates the VAPID key once and `deploy.sh` keeps it (`portal-push-vapid-private-key`). With no key, push is off everywhere and the card says so. The owner sets nothing.
  - **Evidence:**
    - `tests/test_portal_push.py` passes (83 tests), including the RFC 8291 Appendix A vector byte for byte and real HTTP to a fake push service on 127.0.0.1. The full Super Admin gates pass too.
    - Playwright on synthetic seed data (49 checks): headless Chromium cannot register with Google's push service, so the browser's subscription was stubbed in the page and pointed at the local fake service. The card states, test sends, a staff question reaching the device, decryption, VAPID verification, the worker's notification (via CDP), the click guard, axe (light and dark) and overflow at 320, 390 and 768 were all checked.
    - Screenshots are in the W12 scratchpad (`shots/w12-push/`).
  - **Next:** after merge and deploy, the owner turns notifications on from Account on a real phone and presses "Send a test notification" (iPhone: install the app first).

- **29 Oct 23:55: client portal Phase 1, the installable app (W11; branch `worktree-agent-aec1d46aca8f6a2d8`, not merged).**
  - **Built:** the portal installs from the browser (no app store). It has:
    - a manifest, service worker and offline page at the portal root, absent on the admin host and in staff preview;
    - icons generated from the Vitalos symbol;
    - a bottom tab bar at 52rem or narrower and in the installed app (Home, Challenges, Questions, Notifications with the unread badge, More);
    - an "Install the app" card on the Account page.
  - **Privacy:** the service worker caches only public static files and the offline page, never workspace pages, partials, downloads or exports, so signing out needs no purge. The rules are in ADR-056, "Phase 1: installable app".
  - **Evidence:**
    - `tests/test_portal_pwa.py` passes, as do the full Super Admin gates.
    - Playwright on synthetic seed data (26 checks): the worker registers and controls the page, and offline navigation, even to visited pages, shows the offline page. The cache holds only `/static/` files and `/portal/offline/`. There is no horizontal overflow at 320, 390 or 768, and desktop at 1440 is unchanged.
    - Screenshots are in the W11 scratchpad (`shots/w11-pwa/`).
  - **Deferred:**
    - Web Push needs VAPID keys and a dependency decision.
    - Native apps need paid store accounts, which the owner must buy.

- **29 Oct 00:05: merged and verified in production.**
  - **Merge:** the owner said "Merge"; #106 was squash-merged as `dd61f63` with all 19 checks green on head `6f544cb`.
  - **Website (Vercel):** `/ai-data` serves the redesign ("AI that takes work off your team's hands"). `/ai-data`, `/ai-data/demonstrator`, `/ai-data/contact` (guided brief), `/ai-data/solutions`, `/ai-data/approach` and `/pay` return 200.
  - **Super Admin (Azure, run 40789960766):**
    - Super Admin CI on `main` was green, and the pre-migration backup succeeded.
    - The release job applied the migrations before the new image took traffic, and the post-deploy check reports healthy on `dd61f63`.
    - The admin answers `/healthz/` 200. `/ai-data/`, `/client-portal/` and `/billing/` redirect to login. An unsigned `POST /api/ai-data/brief-assist/` gets 401.
  - **Portal:**
    - `deploy.sh` wrote the Cloudflare record for `portal.vitalos.co.uk` (DNS only) and bound the free managed certificate ("Portal host live").
    - `/healthz/` and `/sign-in/` return 200, and `/` redirects to sign-in.
    - `/login/`, `/ai-data/`, `/client-portal/`, `/admin/` and the brief-assist API all return 404 on the portal host.
    - The CSRF cookie is host-only (no `Domain`). CSP, HSTS and `X-Frame-Options: DENY` are present.
    - There is no horizontal overflow at 1440 or 390 px.
  - **Found in production and fixed:** the hidden "Skip to content" link cast its shadow into the top-left corner of every portal page. The shadow now shows only while the link is focused. Checked against the live page with the patched stylesheet.
  - **Screenshots:** lead scratchpad `shots/prod2/` (the website pages and the portal sign-in at 1440 and 390, plus the focused skip link).

- **28 Oct 20:35: #106 ready for review; the full CI is green on `2fa8db6`** (all jobs, including e2e and axe, e2e-draft, SEO and Lighthouse, storybook-a11y, visual, pgTAP and the Super Admin container smoke test). M8 is done apart from the merge, which is held for the owner's review (see HANDOFF.md).

- **28 Oct 20:20: review fixes merged (W10, `f3c26c6`); final gates green.**
  - **M1:** a newer shared version blocks every decision on an older one.
  - **M2:** per-workflow daily shares of the AI run cap (brief assist and portal assistant at 30% each, so staff keep headroom). There is also a per-member assistant limit of 10 an hour with an honest compiled answer. A bug was found and fixed along the way: every portal assistant call shared one run ref.
  - **M3:** customers append only to their own files; sharing exposes only the pinned file version (`FileVersion.customer_visible`, migration `portal` 0003).
  - **L1:** non-numeric ids give 404.
  - **L2:** events for unpublished targets are hidden (migration `portal` 0004).
  - **L3:** decisions and brief reviews lock and re-check.
  - **L4:** `.doc` and `.xls` are refused in the portal.
  - **L5:** brief assist writes a pending row before the model call.
  - **L6:** `next` is validated.
  - **Question ids** are renumbered.
  - 50 new tests. The reviewer's suspicions about cookie tossing and reset timing are recorded as follow-ups in ADR-056.
  - **Lead gate on the final tree:** ruff, format, the email guard, `makemigrations --check`, **pytest 1565 passed**, `recon_eval`, `aidata_eval`, bandit, the migration guard and Prettier, all PASS. gitleaks over history is clean.

- **28 Oct 21:15: integration complete (W5, W6, W7, W8, W9); independent review done; fixes in progress.**
  - **Merges:** W6 (guided brief) `471a52f`, W9 (seams, AC-1 to AC-12 journey test, `experience_seed_demo`, DEMO.md) `c906942`.
  - **Lead gates on the full tree:**
    - Web, all PASS: `format:check`, `check:raw-colours`, `check:turbo-env`, `content:types:check`, lint, typecheck, `pnpm test`, `check:boundaries`, `check:security`, `check:email`, and the `web` build.
    - Super Admin, all PASS: ruff, format, the email guard, `makemigrations --check`, **pytest 1514 passed**, `recon_eval`, `aidata_eval`, bandit, and the migration guard.
    - CI on #106 is green for every job that runs on a draft.
  - **gitleaks false positive fixed** (`a62b69c`): a sessionStorage key name was allowlisted by exact value. Reproduced locally (1 finding without the entry, 0 with it).
  - **Provenance fix (lead, `aea77e4`).** Found reviewing W9's screenshots, and flagged independently by the review. The portal showed the whole notification email (marker, contact rows) or a staff paste as "Your words", and "What you told us" read "No problem description was recorded". Now:
    - Only customer-authored text is a customer statement.
    - A paste never is.
    - Opportunities without an enquiry carry Vitalos's wording as agreed facts.
    - The portal and experience tests pass (175).
  - **Independent review (M7) of `471a52f`:** no critical or high findings. Isolation, the customer/staff boundary, invitations, file downloads, the signed brief-assist endpoint, XSS and AI safety held up.
    - Medium: M1, contractual acceptance of a superseded version; M2, public and customer callers can exhaust the shared daily AI run cap; M3, customer versions appended to staff files, and earlier internal versions of a shared file downloadable.
    - Low: L1, 500 on non-numeric ids; L2, events after unpublish; L3, approval and brief races; L4, legacy `.doc`/`.xls`; L5, brief-assist burst counting; L6, staff open redirect; plus a question-id mismatch.
    - W10 is fixing them test-first.

- **28 Oct 20:30: operational quality.**
  - **Lead web gate on W5 + W7 + W8** (`801cb75`), all PASS: `check:turbo-env`, `content:types:check`, lint, typecheck, `pnpm test`, `check:boundaries`, `check:security`, `check:email`, and the `web` production build. `format:check` failed only on ADR-056 (W8 had not run Prettier); fixed and re-checked.
  - **Dependency advisories** (`a3e1f82`, `30bbb33`):
    - `postcss` override raised to 8.5.23.
    - `fast-uri` override added at 3.1.9.
    - `filelock` 4.2.1 (dev requirements).
    - `pnpm audit`: no known vulnerabilities at any level. `pip-audit --strict` is clean for both requirements files.
    - Recorded in `docs/security/dependency-advisories.md`.
  - **Pre-existing defect fixed** (`1da310e`): two raw `rgb()` shadows in the Relay widget became `--relay-shadow-*` tokens, so `pnpm check:raw-colours` (and the documented local `pnpm check`) passes again. Values are unchanged.

- **28 Oct 20:05: W5 (marketing and design) merged** (`33c5fc6`).
  - **Conflicts:** docs only. The ADR index is now the union of rows (48).
  - **Seam caught by W7's drift test:** W5 added a teal `signal` token role, so the Super Admin token CSS was regenerated (`e28d3a1`). Marketing and admin now share it.
  - **Lead review of the screenshots:**
    - The hero is a click-through and labelled "Synthetic data" and "Scripted example, not live AI".
    - Checks expand to the cited source line.
    - The demonstrator shows the source beside the results, marks exceptions in text and colour, and keeps evaluation tables in a secondary Evidence section.
  - **Copy check:** "a fixed fee agreed in writing" is pre-existing approved copy (`copy.ts`), not a new commitment.
  - **Bundle:** `/ai-data` went from 195,982 to 205,166 B gzip. The budget was raised to 222,000, with the justification in ADR-054. The demonstrator rose to 200,106 B (budget 206,000). Solutions and approach dropped to 191,076 B (`sideEffects: false`).
  - **Noted:** on 390 px phones the existing "Ask Vitalos" launcher overlaps the end of the hero bullet list, as it does site-wide. This is pre-existing and left as is.
  - **W6** was told to merge `e28d3a1` and use `@vitalos/ui/interactive`.

- **28 Oct 19:40: W8 (client portal) merged** (`39524ce`).
  - **Conflicts resolved:**
    - `opportunity.html`: kept W7's tabbed layout; the portal panel comes in through `_opportunity_extensions.html` in the workspace tab.
    - The ADR index, PLAN and TASKS: kept both lanes' sections.
  - **Deploy:** `PORTAL_DOMAIN` now follows W8's `PORTAL_HOST` (`28e3d45`).
  - **Lead gate on main plus W7** (`07ddb65`), all PASS:
    - ruff and format, the email guard, `makemigrations --check`;
    - pytest 1340 passed on PostgreSQL 16;
    - `recon_eval`, `aidata_eval` (22/22), bandit;
    - the migration guard.
  - **Lead review of W8 screenshots:** the dashboard leads with "What we need from you"; blockers name who is responsible; managed systems are labelled manually reported or stale; approvals are version-specific (v1 approved, v2 awaiting a decision).
  - **W9 started** on `28e3d45`: admin ↔ portal seams (brief continuity, proposal → project, portal items in the work queue, stage visibility), the AC-1 to AC-12 journey test, `experience_seed_demo` and DEMO.md. Running: W5, W6, W9.

- **28 Oct 19:00: W7 (admin workspace) reported and was merged** into `claude/amazing-cray-miqs1x` (merge `cd98ceb`, 87 files).
  - **Lead review:** the brief-assist endpoint checks the signature before reading any field or switch, fails closed with no keys, rate-limits per visitor and globally, and stores hashes only. Every workspace view is gated to SuperAdmin or ServiceLead. The `mark_safe` call only wraps static icon markup. The migrations (`aidata` 0003, `aicore` 0002) are additive.
  - **Decision kept:** Viewers stay refused on all AI & Data pages (ADR-026: opportunities hold personal data). A redacted read-only view would be an owner decision.
  - **Pre-existing defect found** (not in CI): `pnpm check:raw-colours` fails on `main` because of two raw `rgb()` shadows in `packages/relay-widget/src/panel.css`. It is outside this scope and logged for a follow-up.
  - **W6 resumed** (the cap allows three: W5, W6, W8) with the amended signing contract: the existing v1 scheme with the new scope `assist`.

- **28 Oct 18:10:**
  - The owner approved `portal.vitalos.co.uk` and the overnight execution brief.
  - W6 paused at a checkpoint.
  - The additional requirements (durable tasks, visibility surfaces, notification retries, evaluation cases, funnel) were sent to W5, W7 and W8.
  - `portal.vitalos.co.uk` currently has no DNS records (checked over DoH), so it is free to create.
- **28 Oct 17:56:** #105 (docs checkpoint) merged.
- **28 Oct 17:50:** W5 to W8 started, each with the shared brief (lead scratchpad `briefs/shared.md`, summarised in MILESTONES.md).

- **28 Oct 19:30: W9 (integration seams and demonstration).** Full Super Admin gate green on the combined tree before changes (1486 passed). Added: the approved brief and the original enquiry carry into a linked challenge as a draft with provenance tags; "Create portal project from proposal" (idempotent, unpublished, no prices); portal items and stuck AI tasks in the work queue; the opportunity-stage to customer-stage map with an audited "Update customer-visible stage"; a status strip for staff; `experience_seed_demo`; `tests/test_experience_journey.py` (AC-1 to AC-12 plus failure recovery); [DEMO.md](DEMO.md). Migration `portal` 0002 is additive. Screenshots: lead scratchpad `shots/w9-journey/`.
